    <h3> By Shauna Ricketts </h3>

<div class="story">
<p> NEW YORK, October 26, 2025 - The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents over 10,000 writers, went on strike between May 2 and September 27, 2023. Lasting 148 days, the strike was the second longest strike in the guild’s history. The 2023 WGA Strike overlapped with the 2023 actor’s union strike (SAG-AFTRA). The 2023 writers’ strike has lasting impacts on the film and television industry. The impacts of the 2023 writers’ strike include the economic footprint, treatment of AI, changes to residuals and changes in labor force. </p>

<p> According to the 
        <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2023/12/06/a-deep-dive-into-the-economic-ripples-of-the-hollywood-strike/"> Michigan Journal of Economics</a> the strike cost the entertainment industry roughly $5 billion nationwide. According to Variety, TV and film writer earnings fell $603 million in 2023. The Writers Guild of America reported that the number of TV writing jobs dropped by 42% for the 2023–2024 season, a loss of 1,319 positions. </p>

    <h4>Treatment of Artifical Intelligence</h4>

<p> The newly adopted writers’ contract set up boundaries to ensure that AI is controlled and does not replace writers in the film and tv industry. The 
    <a href="https://www.wga.org/contracts/know-your-rights/artificial-intelligence"> 
contracts<a/> allow writers to use ChatGPT for research if they wish to, though they legally cannot be asked to use AI tools. As a result of the vote AI cannot generate scripts that are then produced. </p>

    <h4>Changes to Residuals</h4>

<p> As a result of negotiations, writers are eligible for a monetary bonus if their program is viewed by 20% or more of the platform’s subscribers within 90 days of release. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-bonuses-wga-dga-hollywood-unions-1236122481/"> The Hollywood Reporter<a/> bonuses range between $9,000 to $16,400 for a TV episode and up to $40,500 for a feature film. </p>

<p> Post strike, non-union work persisted and increased competition for limited union jobs. Some writers 

<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/tv-writers-fewer-jobs-wga-1236366938/"> 
reported<a/> over 600 applications for a single staff writer position. About 37% fewer union episodic TV series aired in the 2023-2024 season. </p>
